    Hi, my name is Amy Fong. Welcome to my personal website! I created this in the Spring of 2017 for the
      UC Berkeley Web Design Decal in order to showcase the HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills I developed.
      <br><br>
      My goal for this website is to show the various places that have personal significance to me. It could be
      places where I've lived, places where my loved ones lived, places I loved visiting, or anything else.
      My hope is that with time, I'll add more and more markers around the map, and this site can be like a
      personal scrapbook for me to log all the great memories and experiences I've had.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for looking at my site! I hope you enjoyed my personal stories.

            I grew up in Newbury Park, California. My dad and sister still live there, so I visit a couple times a year.
            Newbury Park will always be special to me because it's where I experienced all the first real challenges,
            disappointments, and heartbreaks in my life, and overcame them.

            My best friends in Newbury Park were the ones I did sports with. I loved running and playing lacrosse,
            and these hobbies brought me really close with my teammates. I think sports were very formative for me
            because I was forced to learn that sometimes, no matter how hard I tried at something, I might not always
            be the best at it.

            I took a lot of math and science classes in high school, but I was too focused on getting
            good grades to get the full experience out of my classes. I wish I could go back and try harder
            to understand <i>why</i> math and science was important outside of the context of getting accepted
            into college.

          My mother lives in Washington, DC, and I visited her a couple times last year. I miss her a lot,
          but I'm happy that she moved. She had me when she was a PhD student, and I'm sure that she gave
          up advancement in her career somewhat to raise me. Finally, last year she made a big career move
          and I'm really proud!
